**Barcoded Genomic Library Analysis**

A Python pipeline for processing and analyzing barcoded sequencing data from pooled genomic libraries. This notebook demonstrates barcode extraction, gene mapping, and visualization of expression patterns across multiple samples.
Overview
Barcoded libraries are widely used in functional genomics screens, CRISPR experiments, and multiplexed sequencing applications. This workflow simulates realistic FASTQ data with sample-specific expression profiles and provides tools for:

Barcode identification and extraction from sequencing reads
Mapping barcodes to gene annotations
Quantifying gene abundance across samples
Visualizing differential expression patterns

**Requirements**
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn

Usage
Run cells sequentially to generate simulated data, process reads, and produce visualizations including heatmaps and comparative bar charts.
